# perfpy

A library that personally helps me understand the performance of common python code (and in turn, it might help you understand it too!)

![Python package](https://github.com/mr-uuid/perfpy/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg?branch=master&event=check_run)

# Todo
- [ ] Make a table of the performance of each function ...
    - [ ] Open this up in a notebook!
